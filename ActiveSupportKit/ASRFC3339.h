/**
 * Converts an RFC 3339 date-time string to a date.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt">Request for Comments
 * 3339</a> describes a standard Internet date-time format as follows.
 * `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ` where `yyyy-mm-dd` describes the year, month
 * and day of month using decimal digits; `hh:mm:ss` describes hours, minutes
 * and seconds. Time is expressed in Zulu time, more commonly known as Greenwich
 * Mean Time. See Apple's Technical Q&A QA1480 for more details.
 *
 * ### Implementation Notes:
 * The implementation searches for the first successful formatter where the
 * resulting date reverse-formats to a matching date string. This may result in
 * a number of formatting and parsing iterations and therefore runs slower than
 * a one-shot attempt. However, the algorithm effectively guarantees reverse
 * translation if and when that becomes necessary. To mitigate the iterative
 * approach, the implementation caches the date formatters.
