/**
 * Walks a JSON object and also checks the given JSON object for circular
 * references, failing if circular.
 * @param object The JSON object to walk, where objects have one of three types:
 * array, dictionary or primitive. Primitives include strings, numbers and
 * date-times. The root JSON object can be any one of these three, as can array
 * elements and dictionary objects. Dictionary keys can be strings only.
 * @result Answers an array of unique objects extracted by walking the JSON @a
 * object. The array contains all primitives, all arrays and their elements, and
 * all dictionaries and their values. The array does _not_ contain dictionary
 * keys. You can extract dictionary keys from the result by picking out the
 * dictionaries. Answers `nil` if the JSON object contains circular references.
 *
 * Walks the JSON object, adding each object to the resulting array
 * one-by-one unless it encounters an object already seen. Checking for circular
 * references uses the <code>-[NSArray firstObjectCommonWithArray:]</code>
 * method. If using an array is not efficient, the implementation could improve
 * by using a set rather than an array. As a disadvantage in that case, the
 * ordering would become undefined. Dictionaries already make their ordering
 * undefined.
